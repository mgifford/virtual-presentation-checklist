# Virtual Presentation Checklist
A short list of suggestions for better presentations. 

- Good Lighting from the front so people can see you clearly
- Professional space or background 
- Recent familiarity with the technology
- Position of the camera - be able to look at the camera at eye level
- Distance - frame page with face, neck & shoulders
- Stand up or lean forward
- Good audio is important - don't trust the built-in mic, earbuds can help, but often a USB connected device will be better
- Don't rely on your wifi, strength can fluctiate. Make sure you're plugged into your router
- Make sure someone else has a copy of your slides
- Be interactive
- Having a moderator helps, if only to be repsonsible for checking the chats
